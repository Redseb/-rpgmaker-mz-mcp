 * This is the plugin-side twin of the project tile-catalog overlay (Phase 4a): the
 * built-in {@link PLUGIN_COMMAND_REGISTRY} is a narrow hand-maintained allowlist,
 * and a project's own plugin sources are the real source of truth. Merging the scan
 * over the allowlist turns plugin-command validation from "the 1 plugin we hardcoded"
 * into actual per-project coverage.
 *
 * Everything here fails soft: a project with no `js/plugins` dir, an unreadable
 * file, or a plugin with no annotation block simply contributes nothing.
